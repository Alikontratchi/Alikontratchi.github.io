Tabriz weather

The city of Tabriz is considered one of the attractions of Iran's tourism, with many foreign and domestic tourists traveling throughout the year. The city has a relatively cold climate, so that in winter the snow is whitening, and in the other seasons, you will feel its unique chill to the bone. This cool weather makes tourists feel tired and watch for the city for hours.

Customs of Tabriz city

The people of this part of our beloved Iran, the Turkic language and the Azeri language, have somewhat preserved their traditions, but with the passing of time and the development of this city as a metropolis, the lives of people took the urban smell and the traditions in their lives they became weaker. Although many people in Tabriz still keep customs and traditions in the form of a city and transmit their children. At the festivals, most of the martyrs could be such customs. For example, before the Feast of Nowruz, the relatives come together to replace the ceremonies of samogitian.

Another tradition of the Azerbaijani people is dance and music, which is done in a completely different way. Among them, one can mention the Azeri dance, which is also noted in other countries, and many people attend various classes to learn them.
